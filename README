Crypt::OpenSSL::VerifyX509 - simple verify-cert module, in XS.

This module provides certificate verification, along the lines of
"openssl verify". While Crypt::OpenSSL::CA can do this, and is
fully-featured, it uses Inline::C, which can present deployment
problems.

Major dependency:
 * Crypt::OpenSSL::X509
